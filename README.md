**Key Features**:

- Precise Segment Extraction: The script allows you to define precise start and end times for each segment using timecodes.
- Multiple Segments: You can extract multiple segments from a single video file, each with its own project name.
- Lossless Copy: The script uses FFmpeg's copy codec options to ensure lossless video and audio quality in the extracted segments.
- Easy to Use: Simply define the timecodes and project names in the script, and it will handle the rest.
- Automation: This tool can be useful for content creators, video editors, or anyone needing to split a video into smaller segments efficiently.

**How to Use**:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system.
3. Modify the `timecodes` list in the script to specify the start and end times along with project names.
4. Run the script, and it will extract the specified segments into separate MKV files.

**Example**:

Suppose you have a video file and want to extract segments like "Color_Flipper," "Counter," "Reviews," and more. You can use this script to automate the extraction process, saving you time and effort.
